Atoms are the fundamental particles that constitute chemical elements. Each atom comprises a nucleus containing protons and typically neutrons, encircled by electrons bound through electromagnetic forces. The distinctiveness of chemical elements arises from the number of protons in their atoms; for instance, sodium atoms have 11 protons, while copper atoms have 29. Atoms sharing the same proton count but differing in neutron numbers are termed isotopes of that element.

With typical diameters around 100 picometers, atoms are exceedingly smallâ€”approximately a million carbon atoms span the width of a human hair. Their minuscule size renders them invisible under conventional microscopes, as they are smaller than the shortest wavelength of visible light. Predicting atomic behavior using classical physics is challenging due to quantum effects.

The nucleus accounts for over 99.9994% of an atom's mass. Protons carry a positive electric charge, whereas neutrons are neutral, resulting in a positively charged nucleus. Negatively charged electrons are attracted to this nucleus, and when an atom has equal numbers of protons and electrons, it remains electrically neutral. An imbalance leads to ions: an excess of electrons forms a negative ion (anion), and a deficit results in a positive ion (cation).

Electrons are drawn to the nucleus by electromagnetic forces, while protons and neutrons are held together by the nuclear force, which generally surpasses the repulsive electromagnetic force among protons. However, if the repulsive force exceeds the nuclear force, the nucleus can split, leading to nuclear decay.

Atoms can bond with others to form chemical compounds like molecules or crystals. The formation and breaking of these bonds underpin most physical changes observed in nature, a central focus of chemistry.

History of Atomic Theory

In Philosophy

The concept that matter consists of tiny, indivisible particles dates back to ancient cultures. The term "atom" derives from the Greek "atomos," meaning "uncuttable." This idea was rooted in philosophical reasoning rather than scientific evidence.

Dalton's Law of Multiple Proportions

In the early 19th century, John Dalton proposed that elements combine in simple whole-number ratios, suggesting the existence of discrete atomic particles.

Discovery of the Electron

In 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered the electron, revealing that atoms have internal structure and are divisible.

Discovery of the Nucleus

Ernest Rutherford's 1911 gold foil experiment led to the discovery of the atomic nucleus, indicating that most of an atom's mass is concentrated in a central, positively charged core.

Bohr Model

In 1913, Niels Bohr introduced a model where electrons orbit the nucleus in defined energy levels, explaining atomic emission spectra.

Discovery of Protons and Neutrons

Subsequent research identified protons as positively charged particles within the nucleus and neutrons as neutral particles, both contributing to atomic mass.

The Current Consensus Model

Modern atomic theory describes a dense nucleus surrounded by a probabilistic "cloud" of electrons, with quantum mechanics governing their behavior.

Structure

Subatomic Particles

Atoms consist of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, with electrons in surrounding orbitals.

Nucleus

The nucleus contains protons and neutrons bound by the strong nuclear force, accounting for most of the atom's mass.

Electron Cloud

Electrons form a cloud around the nucleus, occupying regions called orbitals, with their positions described by probability distributions.

Properties

Nuclear Properties

The number of protons (atomic number) defines the element, while the number of neutrons determines the isotope.

Mass

Atomic mass is primarily due to protons and neutrons, with electrons contributing minimally.

Shape and Size

Atoms are roughly spherical, with sizes determined by the extent of the electron cloud.

Radioactive Decay

Unstable nuclei can decay, emitting radiation and transforming into different elements.

Magnetic Moment

Both electrons and the nucleus can have magnetic moments, influencing atomic behavior in magnetic fields.

Energy Levels

Electrons occupy discrete energy levels; transitions between them involve absorption or emission of specific energy quanta.

Valence and Bonding Behavior

The arrangement of electrons, especially in the outermost shell, determines an atom's chemical bonding properties.

States

Atoms can exist in various energy states, including ground and excited states, affecting their chemical and physical behavior.

Identification

Atoms are identified by their atomic number, mass number, and isotopic composition.

Origin and Current State

Formation

Atoms formed during the Big Bang and through stellar nucleosynthesis, creating the elements found today.

Earth

Earth's matter comprises various elements, with atoms combining to form minerals, organic compounds, and other substances.

Rare and Theoretical Forms

Superheavy Elements

Elements beyond uranium (atomic number 92) are synthesized in laboratories and are typically unstable.

Exotic Matter

Theoretical forms of matter, such as antimatter and quark-gluon plasma, involve unusual atomic configurations.
